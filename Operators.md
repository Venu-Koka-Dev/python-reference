# Types of Operators  
# I. Arithmetic Operators (Mathematical operations)
     # 1. Addition operation       : +   
     # 2. Subtraction operation    : -
     # 3. Multiplication operation : *
     # 4. Division operation       : /    Ex. 5 / 2 : 2.5 (float)
     # 5. Modulus operator         : %    Ex. 10 / 3 : 1 (int)
     # 6. Exponentiation operator  : ** 
     # 7. Floor division           : //   Ex. 10 / 3 : 3 (int)

# II. Appending Operator (Concatenating / Joining  Operator) : +, *    
#print("Venu" + "10")   # Venu10
#print("Venu" * 4)      # VenuVenuVenuVenu

# III. Assignment Operator : =
cust_name = "Venu"

# IV. Comparison Operators 
     # 1. Equality operator         : ==
     # 2. Not equality operator     : !=
     # 3. Greater than              : >
     # 4. Greater than or equal to  :  >=
     # 5. Less than                 : <
     # 6. Less than or equal to     : <=

cust_name = "Venu"
print(cust_name, 5 > 10, cust_name * 5)
