1. Pre-checking
2. Steps

###### 1. Pre-checking
In some operating systems, Python is pre-installed. For example, Linux based Operating systems like Ubuntu or macOS based Operating systems.
Microsoft's windows based operating systems do not come with Python pre-installed.
To check if Python is pre-installed in a computer, open the CLI and type in either of the following commands :
python
python3
python --version
python -v

## 2. Go to Python Software Foundation's official website to download and install the Python Software
Official website of Python : python.org
Choose the right Python software based on :
 a. Type of Processor : 64 bit or 32 bit
 b. Type of OS : Windows (64 bit or 32 bit) or Linux based or macOS

## Types of Variables in an Operating system :
All modern operating systems are multi-user operating systems.
1. Temporary variables - deleted once the CLI session in which they are created is closed
2. Permanent variables or Environment variables - are retained by the Operating system even if the computer is shut down. They are reloaded every time a new CLI session is opened.
   a. User variables - privately scoped to a user that is logged in
   b. System variables - scorped globally and available to all the users of the computer

    set myName=Venu
    echo %myName%
    echo %Path%  ->  System values + User values
   
## Versioning in Python 
PSF adopted Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 i.e. Python X.Y.Z  or Python major.minor.patch

## Python 2  Vs  Python 3
Almost all organizations have adopted Python 3 in their projects. 

## Types of Python Releases
1. Stable release : suitable for Production - Ex. 3.13.0
2. Pre-release : suitable for learning, exploring and testing the cutting edge(latest) features provided in the language
   A Release plan cycle can contain different phases : Alpha phase -> Beta phase -> Release Candidate phase
   Ex: A new Python X.Y.Z can have two Alpha phases, three Beta phases & two Release Candidate phases
       Python 3.14.0a1 -> Python 3.14.0a2 -> Python 3.14.0b1 -> Python 3.14.0b2 -> Python 3.14.0b3 -> Python 3.14.0rc1 -> Python 3.14.0rc2 -> Python 3.14.0 (Stable) 
    

Note the installation folder : C:\Users\91703\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313

## What comes bundled with Standard Python Software installed from PSF's python.org
1. Python compiler - python.exe
2. Documentation
3. PIP - python package manager
4. tkinter
5. IDLE - code editor
6. Python test suite
7. py launcher
etc.

## Modes of Python Interpreter
1. REPL Mode (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) or Interactive mode - generally used for testing small snippets/commands & exploring commands
2. File Mode (Script Mode) - used to run programs 
   RUN COMMAND>python C:\Users\91703\Desktop\pylearn\demo.py
