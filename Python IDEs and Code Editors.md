## IDEs Vs Code Editors
Code editor is as simple as a text editor with core features : usually smaller, quicker & less feature rich than an IDE
 a. Save our work and reload code files, language help using intellisense, code completion, syntax highlighting and code formatting capabilities
 b. Can execute code -  run code from within the environment - integrated terminal 
 c. Provides debugging support (stepping through our code as it runs)
 d. Can interact with source control system

Integrated Development Environment integrates several tools specifically designed for software development including: larger and feature rich + require more knowledge to use properly
 a. An editor designed to handle code (syntax highlighting and auto-completion)
 b. Build, execution, and debugging tools 
 c. Some form of source control
 d. Build and test tools
 e. Integrated documentation browser
 f. An extension model with rich marketplace add-ons
 
## Categories
Two broad categories of tools: 
1. Built exclusively for Python development
    a. PyCharm
        - available in both paid (Professional) and free open-source (Community) editions
    b. Spyder
        - open source
        - built & optimized for Data science workflows
    c. Thonny
        - for beginners
        - come built-in with Python version
   
3. Built for general development that you can use for Python
    a. Visual Studio Code + Python (extension by Microsoft)
        - open source & free
    b. Visual Studio + Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS)
        - built for Windows and macOS only

    d. Sublime Text
        - not free (but we can use the evaluation version for an indefinite period of time)
        - Installing extensions can be tricky, and thereâ€™s no direct support for executing or debugging code from within the editor
    e. GNU Emacs
    f. Vi (now Vim)
